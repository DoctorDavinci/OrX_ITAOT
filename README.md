OrX Kontinuum - Is There Anybody Out There

OrX Kontinuum brings Geo Caching, Scuba Diving, the joy of W[ind/S] and more to KSP ..... It's purpose is to give you more reasons and ways to explore


--Feature List--

------------------------------------------------------------------
OrX Scuba Kerb
------------------------------------------------------------------

OrX Scuba Kerb gives your kerbals the ability to explore the depths of the oceans ......

 

- When you are EVA and splashed as well as in an atmosphere containing oxygen, the Scuba Kerb menu will automatically open (if you are the active vessel) ... it will automatically close if you are no longer splashed or no longer EVA

- The Oxygen slider displays your Kerbals' total Oxygen amount which depletes over time while underwater

- If you are at the surface of the ocean or on land your Oxygen will replenish if in an atmosphere that contains Oxygen

- Ballast is controlled by hotkeys while your Kerbal is splashed ... Q to trim up, E to trim down, Z to emergency surface and X to emergency dive

- You can also hold your current depth by pressing the 'Tab' key

- While diving be aware of Nitrogen Narcosis and pay attention to your Martini level ... the higher the Martini level the closer you are to being drunk

- Your Martini level will slowly drop as your Kerbal adjusts to the pressure ... PLEASE NOTE: Don't go too deep too fast or the pressure might get to you (it gives you that sinking feeling)

- If your Martini level reaches 6 then your Kerbal is drunk and it will automatically attempt to hold its depth, however if you are sinking fast your drunk self may be unable to recover and will continue to sink into the depths in search of the Kraken

- Kerbals who have been lost to the sea can be revived if you can find a way to get them to the surface

- Beware the Bends ... You will experience decompression as you rise to the surface and gasses that have built up inside your Kerbal due to the pressure will be released as you ascend which could potentially cause your kerbal to go 'POP' (Not Implemented Yet)

--OrX W[ind/S] -- (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL - CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE)
------------------------------------------------------------------

By filtering a low AC current through a signal generator using the W[ind/S] formula in relation with the Tesla Equation ( TL = Mc^2 ) and then passing the resulting signal through a Ferro-fluid composed of Buckyballs, Magnetite and Soy sandwiched between multiple layers of Carbon Nanotube sheeting (a SAIL ... S-ratio Accumulated Inductance Laminate), oscillations are generated within the SAIL causing it to move

    W = Weber's Law
    i = imaginary number
    n = factorial
    d = derivatives
    S = S-ratio

 

- Weber's Law states that any given derivative of a factorial of an imaginary number divided by the S-ratio of a given material is a constant in relation to the ratio of the increment threshold to the background intensity ... PLEASE NOTE: When you measure increment thresholds (the threshold here being oscillation amplitude) on varied intensity backgrounds, the thresholds increase in proportion to the background (the background in this case being the magnetic flux lines of the planet)

- S-ratio is a rock magnetic parameter employed to provide a relative measure of the contributions of low and high coercivity material to a sample's Saturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (SIRM)

- Another kind of IRM can be obtained by first giving the magnet a saturation remanence in one direction and then applying and removing a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is called demagnetization remanence or DC demagnetization remanence.

- Yet another kind of remanence can be obtained by demagnetizing the saturation remanence in an ac field. This is called AC demagnetization remanence or alternating field demagnetization remanence.

- For manual control of W[ind/S], open the OrX W[ind/S] menu and you will see some sliders for controlling the blow intensity, variability and tease timing (how often things change) as well as an entry field to manually select the W[ind/S] heading (0 to 360 degrees)

- There is also a button to turn the W[ind/S] on or off in the menu

- When W[ind/S] is enabled any part that is a lifting surface will be affected ... How much of an effect is directly related to the deflection lift coefficient of the part and the angle at which the part intersects with the W[ind/S] heading

- The Weather Simulation is a controller for controlling the W[ind/S] direction based on a number of factors and is turned on from within the OrX W[ind/S] menu .... PLEASE NOTE: This is experimental and is in the process of being written so consider it a use at your own risk

OrX HoloKron System
------------------------------------------------------------------

The OrX HoloKron System brings GeoCaching to KSP ... Now you can leave a trail of breadcrumbs spanning the solar system (and beyond?)

Now Kerbo-not's can go to a location and create a 'HoloKron' that will save the location coordinates (including SOI and other pertinent data) to a config file (.orx file) ... PLEASE NOTE: If within an atmosphere you must be landed or splashed as well as YOU MUST BE EVA TO CREATE A HOLOKRON

- The creator of the HoloKron can add a craft file that is unlocked and saved to the users save game directory when the HoloKron is opened

- The .orx file created is saved inside of GameData/OrX/Export/ ... Players can share .orx files contained within the GameData/OrX/Export/ directory with other KSP players and the coordinates will be available if they have OrX installed (copy shared HoloKron files to GameData/OrX/HoloKron/)

- Craft files contained in the .orx file have been put through encryption so as to make it difficult for anyone to 'hack' the HoloKron by config editing outside of the game ... If you want to hack the HoloKron you must use the OrX BlackHat (isn't a thing ... yet) or go through the trouble of decoding the .craft file manually (good luck ... lol)

- To start scanning for HoloKrons, click on the green OrX button while in the flight scene ... any HoloKron (.orx file) contained within GameData/OrX/HoloKron/ will be checked to see if it is within the same SOI as the current active vessel and if it is then Pythagoras will check how far away it is
PLEASE NOTE: The distance, the altitude and heading to the closest HoloKron within the current SOI will be displayed in the OrX Kontinuum menu if it is within 100km

- If you are within 2km of a HoloKron location then it will spawn and each of the vessels contained in the HoloKron will be spawned at their saved locations (save your mun base ????)

- To creat a HoloKron you must be EVA ... Go to the location where you want to create the HoloKron and right click on your Kerbal then click on 'HOLOKRONSPAWN' and the HoloKron Creation menu will appear as well as a HoloKron will spawn

- Click on the HoloKron Type button to select from a Geo-Caching or a Challenge HoloKron (HoloKron type is currently locked as Geo-Cache)

- In the 'Name:' text entry box enter a name for your HoloKron ... If a HoloKron of the same name is in the 'OrX/Export' directory the creator will be presented with options to add to the HoloKron of the same name or enter another name when saving
PLEASE NOTE: You can add as many HoloKrons to a single .orx file as you wish, however each HoloKron contained in the .orx file is set up so that it will not be available to a player until the HoloKron that comes before it in the file has been opened (the first HoloKron in the .orx file is unlocked)

- In the 'Password:' text entry box enter a password for your HoloKron ... The purpose of the password is to lock the HoloKron from being added to from an unauthorized HoloKron creator

- Add a description of your HoloKron in the description text entry section ... as you type in a text entry field a new text entry box will appear below it, press 'TAB' to jump to the new text entry field (maximum of 10 lines)

- Click on the 'Add Blueprints' check box to open the Craft Browser ... Select a hangar in the Craft Browser (SPH or VAB from your current game save) then select a craft from the list and click on "Load" to add that craft file as a blueprint ... click cancel to return to the previous menu

- Click on the 'Save Local Vessel' check box to have all landed vessels within a 1km radius and all flying vessel within an 8km radius of the HoloKron will be saved (.orx file) as well all information required for later spawning

- If the HoloKron being created is a Geo-Cache, click on the save button to save the HoloKron

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------

- OrX Kontinuum has no dependancies

- If you see a portal, it's just a Test .... Please Ignore

- HoloKrons should work with mods and DLC parts, however if the user of your .orx file does not have the mods or DLC parts in their game that are on the vessels stored in the file then the vessels will not load
